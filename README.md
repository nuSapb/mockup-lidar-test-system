# Test Specifications for LiDAR Systems

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline the test specifications for LiDAR systems. The specifications cover hardware, software, and system-level testing, with the goal of ensuring that the LiDAR systems are reliable and meet the performance requirements.

## Scope of Tests
The following aspects of the LiDAR system will be tested:
1. Physical Components
  - Laser
  - Optical Unit
  - Data Processing Unit
  - Power and Communication Interface
2. System-Level Performance
  - Accuracy
  - Range
  - Field of View
  - Update Rate
  - Operating Environment
3. Software
  - User Interface
  - Data Processing
  - Communications Protocols
  
## Test Methodologies
The following methodologies will be used to test the LiDAR systems:
1. Design of Experiments (DOE)
  - The DOE methodology will be used to test the performance of the LiDAR systems under different operating conditions.
2. Repeatability and Reproducibility (GR&R) Analysis
  - The GR&R methodology will be used to evaluate the measurement variation of the LiDAR systems.
  
## Data Collection and Analysis
The following tools will be used to collect and analyze test data:
1. Python Programming Language
  - The Python programming language will be used to automate the data collection and analysis processes.
2. Numpy Library
  - The Numpy library will be used to perform mathematical operations on the test data.
